The following objectives are achieved:
• The hosted version of the SecureCodingDojo must be available over the/a network and
must be secure against network-based attacks (e.g. from the public internet or via a
virtual network, depending on your implementation)
• Access to the ‘solutions’ control file by the instructor must also be secure (both during
setup and usage)
• The learners should not be able to bypass the control file restrictions, unless they
rebuild the entire application themselves, of course, from the original github.
