-The following was the objective:

• The hosted version of the SecureCodingDojo must be available over the/a network and
must be secure against network-based attacks (e.g. from the public internet or via a
virtual network, depending on your implementation)
• Access to the ‘solutions’ control file by the instructor must also be secure (both during
setup and usage)
• The learners should not be able to bypass the control file restrictions, unless they
rebuild the entire application themselves, of course, from the original github.


-To achieve that, we made a website which satisfies above criteria. Here is the link: https://dojo.danial-softwares.com/public/index.html
